%   Program will ask user for system of units
%   Based on response, user is asked for
%   empty mass of rocket (kg or slugs)
%   fuelmass (kg or slugs)
%   rate at which rocket burns fuel (kg/sec or slugs/sec)
%   exit velocity of thrust (m/sec or ft/sec)
%   desired height of rocket
%   mass of fuel to add if rocket does not meet desired height
